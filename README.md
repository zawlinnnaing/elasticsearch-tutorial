# elasticsearch-tutorial

My playground repository for learning elasticsearch.

## Setup

In order to setup for elasticsearch playground, you need none other than [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

```bash
docker compose up
```

After docker has run successfully, goes to http://localhost:5601 to access **[Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/kibana/)**. Elasticsearch server will run at http://localhost:9200
